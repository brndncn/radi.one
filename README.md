# Radione
[Radione](http://radi.one/) is an art project and experimental messaging app heavily inspired by the nature of conversations on walkie-talkie radios.
Conversations on Radione are ephemeral, anonymous, and surveillable.
Participants must either understand the flow of conversation well enough or develop a system to explicitly avoid collisions, otherwise, participants may talk over each other, resulting in incomprehensibility.
